This repository contains __Bookker API definition__ (OpenAPI 3.0). 

__Bookker__ has an API-first strategy to help clients develop a new level of advanced digital services for resources management. __Bookker API__ is designed to facilitate programmatic control to Bookker services by its clients. __Bookker API__ helps the client to use __Bookker services__ over a well-defined application programming interface 

This repository contains the definition of the Bookker API in YAML format according to the OpenAPI 3.0 standard.

The API definition may be used as:
- a machine readable complete contract for producers and consumers, ie. what is expected from the API 
- a consistent, complete, single source of truth of the API functionality
- a source for automatic code generation and app building for server providers and client consumers


The OpenAPI definition standard supports standard tools to help with internal and external dev: Open Source tools (![Swagger tools](https://swagger.io/tools/)) and Postman (![Postman tools](https://www.postman.com/product/tools/)). These tools may increasing productivity, speed up new services development and avoid errors in the development process.

Publishing this documentation __Bookker__ makes the API discoverable and readable for dev teams on the web
